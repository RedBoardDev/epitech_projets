> Read `./doc/implementation.md` to learn about how you can implement your own primitives / components into the rendering engine.

# Usage

    1. make
    2. ./raytracer [scene file path]

# Features

* 3D Rendering
* Modulable & Extensible
* Configurable Scenes

# Scenes

You can find some scenes example files in Core/Parzer/scenes, you can also create your own scenes files.

To do so, follow the syntax in the example files, you can add the following primitives :

* Sphere
