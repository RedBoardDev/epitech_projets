## Description

RType is a 2D game based on the original R-Type game. It is a side-scrolling shoot'em up in which the player controls a spaceship to fight against enemies. The player can move the spaceship in two directions, shoot and use a special attack. The goal is to reach the end of the level by destroying all enemies.

This repository contains the client and server of the game. The client is the game itself where the user controls his player, and the server is used to manage the game sessions and the players.
